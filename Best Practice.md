# Best Practice

You are not the first student to write a theses, and you will improve both your workflow and the quality of your final thesis when following established best practices. 
## General

1. **Maintain an Engineer’s Diary**: Keeping a regular log of your progress is essential. On a weekly basis, document what tasks you completed, what you postponed, what you discovered, and what you learned. This habit not only helps you stay organized but also ensures you have a clear record of your work, which can be invaluable when writing your thesis. Additionally, it aids in planning future tasks, allowing you to prioritize and adjust your workflow efficiently.

2. **Seek Input from Colleagues**: Your peers and colleagues can be a great resource for advice and feedback. They may suggest methods, tools, or approaches that you haven’t considered, which could save you time and improve the quality of your work. Engaging in discussions with others fosters collaborative problem-solving and broadens your perspective.

3. **Leverage Existing Software and Libraries**: Where possible, make use of established software tools and libraries to streamline your work. This not only minimizes potential errors but also allows you to focus more on analyzing your results and writing your thesis. Reusing reliable solutions can free up valuable time for critical thinking and refining your research.

## Implementation

1. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Proper documentation is essential, as it not only guides your development process but also becomes a key part of your thesis. Document every step in detail, covering what you did, how you did it, and why certain decisions were made. This documentation should be clear and thorough, allowing others to understand and replicate your process, contributing to the transparency and reproducibility of your work.

2. **Quality Assurance**: Incorporating quality assurance (QA) testing into your implementation is critical to avoid introducing flaws that could bias your study. Regular testing throughout development ensures that your system works as intended and that the results from your experiments or gameplay are reliable.

3. **Balancing through Playtesting**: Balancing is particularly important in game development to ensure that no single element of the game skews results. Playtesting helps identify and address potential imbalances, reducing bias and improving the validity of your findings. This stage ensures that the game is fair and reflects the intended user experience.

4. **Follow Established Documentation Structures**: As discussed in your lectures, use established frameworks like game engineering concepts, ten-pagers, and post-mortems. In software engineering, adhering to structured documentation helps provide clarity and a professional outline of your implementation process, covering all necessary technical details.

5. **Reproducibility**: Ensure that both your thesis and documentation are written in a way that others can reproduce your experiment. Publishing your data, analysis code (e.g., Python notebooks), and the game’s source code is a helpful step toward making your research reproducible. This openness not only strengthens the credibility of your work but also contributes to the broader academic community by enabling further exploration and validation of your findings.

## User Studies

1. **Apply What You Learned**: When conducting user studies, apply the methodologies and principles you’ve learned in your lectures. Following established protocols is crucial to ensure the validity and reliability of your results. This includes designing your study carefully to avoid biases, such as leading questions, which can skew participant responses and compromise the integrity of your findings.

2. **Use Established Scales**: To standardize your results and make your findings comparable to other studies, employ established scales, such as the Likert scale, for measuring user responses. Using such well-known and validated tools strengthens the reliability of your data and aligns your research with academic best practices.

3. **Leverage Resources**: Make use of available resources like the [HCI course at TU Graz](https://courses.isds.tugraz.at/hci/) to inform and guide your user study design. These resources provide valuable insights into best practices for human-computer interaction and user experience research.

4. **Test Your Work**: Before conducting your main study, thoroughly test your work through QA tests, software tests, and playtests to ensure that the system functions properly. Running a pre-study or pilot test is also a good practice to identify potential issues in the study design, allowing for refinements before the full study begins. This helps ensure your study produces accurate, reliable, and unbiased results.
## Citations

1. **Follow a Formal Citation Framework**: Adhere to a formal citation style recommended by your institution or discipline. For example, in Game Studies and Engineering (GSE), the *Chicago Manual of Style* is preferred. Ensure that all citations follow the selected framework consistently throughout your thesis, maintaining professionalism and academic integrity.

2. **Ensure Formal Accuracy**: Citations should be placed precisely where they are required, directly supporting the relevant statements. Double-check that your citations are correct in both format and content, ensuring they are aligned with the specific point you are making. This enhances the credibility of your arguments and prevents any misrepresentation of the cited work.

3. **Cite Only Relevant Sources**: Make sure that the papers you cite are directly relevant to your research. Avoid unnecessary citations or overloading your work with references that do not contribute significantly to your topic. The connection between your citations and content should always be clear and purposeful.

4. **Avoid Non Peer-Reviewed and Tertiary Sources**: Be cautious about relying too heavily on non peer-reviewed sources like blogs, Wikipedia, or general web pages. While these can be useful for background information, they are not considered authoritative in academic writing. Prioritize peer-reviewed papers, books, and reliable primary or secondary sources for a stronger foundation in your thesis. 
## Writing 

1. **Gender-Inclusive Language**: Strive for gender-neutral language by using plural forms, such as "they" instead of "he/she," to avoid gender-specific terms. Additionally, use terms like "person" rather than specifying "woman" or "man" unless the distinction is relevant. This not only makes your writing more inclusive but also more modern and universally applicable.

2. **Examples for Reference**: When writing your thesis, it is helpful to refer to well-done examples of previous theses to understand what works best. Conversely, reviewing poorly executed examples can also highlight common pitfalls, such as disorganized structure or inconsistent language, which you should avoid.

3. **Objective Reflection**: It's important to reflect on your work objectively and stay away from opinionated statements unless required by the context. The goal is to analyze your findings and methodology in an unbiased manner, presenting information as clearly and factually as possible.

4. **Common Writing Mistakes**: Avoid common errors such as excessive use of passive voice, incorrect hyphenation, and inconsistent capitalization. These issues can detract from the professionalism and readability of your thesis. Be mindful of these details, as they often go unnoticed during initial drafts.

5. **Proofreading and Feedback**: Always allow time for thorough proofreading. Have peers or colleagues read through your work and provide feedback. Tools like Grammarly or similar proofreading services are excellent for catching mistakes. In the age of AI, there is little room for typos or easily avoidable errors.

6. **Consistency in Format**: Pick a specific format for your thesis and stick to it throughout. This applies to both content and style. For example, be consistent with tense usage (past vs. present tense) and adhere to formatting guidelines for references, headings, and typefaces. Consistency ensures your work looks polished and professional, making it easier to read and follow.
