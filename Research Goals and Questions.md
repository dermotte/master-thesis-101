# Research Goals vs. Questions

A research goal represents a concrete, measurable end state that marks the completion of your work. Unlike questions, goals describe a specific outcome that can be definitively observed or measured. Your goal is achieved when you reach this predefined state.

Research questions, on the other hand, are formal inquiries that currently lack answers in the scientific literature. An effective research question must be unambiguous, answerable through scientific methods, and non-trivial in nature.
## SMART Goals Framework 

To ensure research goals are well-structured, they should follow the SMART criteria:

- Specific: Clearly defined and focused
- Measurable: Progress can be quantified
- Achievable: Realistic within given constraints
- Relevant: Aligned with broader research objectives
- Time-bound: Completed within a defined timeframe (i.e., 6-month master's thesis)

## Characteristics of Effective Research Goals and Questions:

1. Impact: They should promise meaningful change - offering radical implications, new insights, or fundamental changes to the field
2. Clarity: They must enable clear, concise answers (avoiding simple yes/no responses or overly broad "how to" queries)
3. Feasibility: Answerable within the project's timeframe using available methods
4. Methodology: Clear scientific methods, metrics, and data sets exist for investigation
5. Universal Understanding: The problem statement should be clear to anyone in the field

When formulating both goals and questions, ensure they are precise enough to guide your research while ambitious enough to contribute meaningfully to your field. The goal describes where you want to arrive, while the research questions outline the intellectual puzzles you need to solve to get there.
