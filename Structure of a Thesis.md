# Structure of a Master's Thesis

A well-structured master's thesis follows several general rules to ensure clarity, consistency, and professionalism. First and foremost, maintaining a **consistent format** throughout your thesis is essential. This includes alignment, the proper use of headings, uniform figure and table captions, and correct formatting for emphasized text. A cohesive structure helps guide the reader and makes your work appear polished and well-organized. Additionally, with tools like Grammarly readily available, there is little excuse for grammar errors or typosâ€”proofreading is crucial to ensure your writing is error-free.

When organizing your content, work in a **top-down** manner. Begin by introducing broad, general information and gradually provide more detailed explanations as the thesis progresses. Always ensure that you introduce important concepts and terms before using them, so readers can follow your arguments without confusion. This approach ensures a logical flow of ideas, making your research more accessible and easier to understand.

A common start for defining the chapter of a thesis would be:

### 1. Introduction

- Set the stage by explaining the context, providing motivation, and clearly stating the problem.
- Present your research goal, specific research questions, and describe the scientific method you'll use.
- Provide a clear overview of how the thesis is structured and what each chapter contains.
### 2. Theory
- Present a comprehensive game studies chapter that discusses relevant literature and theoretical models applicable to your game engineering work.
### 3. Related Work

- Review and analyze papers and artifacts that are directly relevant to your research.
- Reflect on these references and explain how their findings inform your thesis work.
### 4. Implementation

- Document your requirements, concept development, and overall design process.
- Explain your general architecture and methodological approach.
- Detail the tools, libraries, and APIs you used in your implementation.
- Highlight necessary technical details and interesting implementation aspects.
### 5. Evaluation

- Present your detailed study design and discuss the results of your pre-study.
- Describe your recruitment process and analyze the demographics of your study population.
- Present and thoroughly discuss your study results and their implications.
### 6. Conclusion and Future Work

- Summarize your findings and reflect on your research contribution to the field.
- Propose future work directions that could be explored in subsequent master's theses.
### 7. References

- Include well-formatted and consistent citations throughout your work.
- Focus primarily on primary and secondary academic sources.
### 8. Indexes & Appendixes

- Include comprehensive lists of figures and tables.
- Append all questionnaires, raw data, and relevant code listings.
